    <h2>Why Mental Wellness Matters</h2>
    <p>Your mental health affects everything in your life: your relationships, work, and overall well-being. By focusing on mental wellness, you can build resilience, cope with stress, and improve your ability to navigate life's challenges. Mental wellness isn't just the absence of mental illness; it's about having a positive mindset, emotional stability, and self-awareness.</p>
